# Break Out Strategy

In this project, I implemented the breakout strategy. I found and removed any outliers. I also tested to see if it has the potential to be profitable using a Histogram and P-Value. For the dataset, I used the end of day from Quotemedia.

This project was the second project (out of eight project) in **AI for trading NanoDegree Program**, offered by Udacity. The rest of projects could be found in my GitHub Page as well.
